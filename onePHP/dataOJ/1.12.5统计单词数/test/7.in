It
was on Saturday, 23 rd October. We walked from the school to the centre of the city. Before the walk, we grouped ourselves into a team of four and planned everything well. It was a hard (tough) work. But during the walk, we supported and helped each other. With the help of many people, we raised over (more than) 50,000 yuan in the end.
