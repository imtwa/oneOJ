When
we go to school, we should ride a bike or take a bus. When we go out for activities, we shouldn¡¯t step on the grass. We can¡¯t draw everywhere. When we go shopping, we¡¯d better use a cloth bag. At home we can save water and electricity. When we leave a room, we should turn off the ligts. At school we can collect wast paper and recycle things, such as bottles, cans and plastic bags. We shoudn¡¯t listen to pop music or spit in pulic.
