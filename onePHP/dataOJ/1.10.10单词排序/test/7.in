Failure  no  longer  will  be  my  payment  for  struggle.  Just  as  nature  made  no  provision  for  my  body  to  tolerate  pain  neither  has  it  made  any  provision  for  my  life  to  suffer  failure.  Failure,  like  pain,  is  alien  to  my  life.  In  the  past  I  accepted  it  as  I  accepted  pain.  Now  I  reject  it  and  I  am  prepared  for  wisdom  and  principles  which  will  guide  me  out  of  the  shadows  into  the  sunlight  of  wealth,  position,  and  happiness  far  beyond  my  most  extravagant  dreams  until  even  the  golden  apples  in  the  Garden  of  Hesperides  will  seem  no  more  than  my  just  reward.
